                    Ian Ly is a 22 year-old student and musician living in San Francisco, California. He currently attends San Francisco State University in the Visual Communications Design program and is set to graduate in 2025.

                    Ian was born in Merriam, Kansas but moved to Santa Cruz, California at a young age. He attended the University of Kansas with a major in Political Science but moved back to California to study Design at SFSU and to pursue his music career. Ian enjoys making art and music, watching movies, playing video games, and searching for the best places to eat out in the Bay Area. He currently tours on-and-off with the Crying Uncle Bluegrass Band.

                    His interests are represented in the media that he streams. Ian enjoys all kinds of music, but he predominantly plays Bluegrass guitar, as represented by his recent streaming of Tony Rice's “Girl From the North Country.” He also enjoys a variety of other music, as just before that he streamed the song “Funeralopolis” from Doom-Metal band Electric Wizard. His interest in the fantasy genre is also represented by his recent streaming of “Conan the Barbarian,” although he didn’t make it very far into the movie.

                    Ian's activity is represented largely through his iPhone, which keeps track of location, browsing, and app data. His browsing history reveals that he has recently paid a parking ticket, signed into his SFSU Outlook email address, looked up the address for a bar he was checking out, and used his Canvas page to do homework. His location data reveals that he recently visited a friend's house in San Rafael and stopped at a Chinese restaurant and a coffee shop along the way. His Southwest Airlines flight history shows that he's been traveling a lot recently, mostly with his band for gigs.

                    Overall, Ian's interests and activity are very apparent through his online footprint, but his activity is slightly less apparent.
